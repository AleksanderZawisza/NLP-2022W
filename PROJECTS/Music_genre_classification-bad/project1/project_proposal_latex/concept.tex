\section{Concept and work plan}

Our project is divided into two parts. The main part consists of the comparison between different word embedding techniques, classifiers and optimization methods for MGC. In the second, smaller part we are going to test a modified approach to the above problem.

\subsection{Work plan}

In accordance with overall deadlines, we plan to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item by November 18th have the architecture of the main part of the project prepared and at least one word embedding technique tested,
    \item by November 25th have the main part of the project finished and the architecture of the modified approach prepared,
    \item by December 9th have both parts of the project finished, the presentation and plan for the second project prepared,
    \item by December 16th have the report of the first project prepared.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risk analysis}

While planning the project we have identified multiple risks, which are presented in the table \ref{tab:risk}. 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{0.5\textwidth}{X|X|X}
        \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Consequence} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\\hline
        not enough time for performing the project because of other obligations & late submission of the project or not finishing it & reducing the project scope by testing smaller numbers of models/techniques \\\hline
        not big enough computational resources to conduct proper experiments & lower quality of conducted experiments & - \\
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Risk analysis}
    \label{tab:risk}
\end{table}

Regarding the second part of the project, as we define it as a hypothesis rather than a thesis, we do not consider unsatisfactory results of the modified approach as a failure. We are interested in the outcome of conducted experiments but we do not have high expectations when it comes to accuracy.
