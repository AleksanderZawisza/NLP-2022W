pop,despite all the snorting against them in works of divinity it has always been my experience that infidelsor freethinkers as they usually prefer to call themselvesare a generally estimable class of men with strong overtones of the benevolent and even of the sentimental this was certainly true for example of leopold bortsch totsaufer for the scharnhorst brewery in baltimore fortyfive years ago he was a sincere friend to the orphans the aged all blind and onelegged men ruined girls opium fiends chinamen oyster dredgers exconvicts the more respectable sort of colored people and all the other oppressed and unfortunate classes of the time and he slipped them first and last many a substantial piece of money nor was he the only baltimore infidel of those days who thus shamed the churchly indeed the name of one of his buddies fred ammermeyer jumps into my memory at once fred and leopold i gathered had serious dogmatic differences for there are as many variations in doctrine between infidels as between christians but the essential benignity of both men kept them on amicable terms and they often cooperated in good works the only noticeable difference between them was that fred usually tried to sneak a little propaganda into his operationsa dodge that the more scrupulous leopold was careful to avoid e sent each and every one of the clergy of the town a copy of paines age of reason three or four times a yearalways disguised as a special delivery or registered letter marked urgent but in the masterpiece of fred ammermeyers benevolent career there was no such attempt at direct missionarying indeed his main idea when he conceived it was to hold up to scorn and contumely by the force of mere contrast the crude missionarying of his theological opponents this idea seized him one evening when he dropped into the central police station to pass the time of day with an old friend a police lieutenant who was then the only known freethinker on the baltimore force christmas was approaching and the lieutenant was in an unhappy and rebellious frame of mindnot because he objected to its orgies as such or because he sought to deny christians its beautiful consolations but simply and solely because he always had the job of keeping order at the annual free dinner by the massed missions of the town to the derelicts of the waterfront and that duty compelled him to listen politely to a long string of pious exhortations many of them from persons he knew to be whited sepulchres why in hell he observed impatiently do all them goddam hypocrites keep the poor bums waiting for two three hours while they get off their goddam whimwham here is a hall full of men who are not had nothing to speak of to eat for maybe three four days and yet they have to set there smelling the turkey and the coffee while ten fifteen sundayschool superintendents and wctyou sisters sing hymns to them and holler against booze i tell you mr ammermeyer it are not human more than once i have saw a whole row of them poor bums pass out in faints and had to send them away in the wagon and then when the chow is circulated at last and they begin fighting for the turkey bones they are not hardly got the stuff down before the superintendents and the sisters begin calling on them to stand up and confess whatever skullduggery they have done in the past whether they really done it or not with us cops standing all around and every man jack of them knows that if they do not lay it on plenty thick there will not be no encore of the giblets and stuffing and two times out of three there are not no encore anyhow for them psalm singers are the stingiest outfit outside hell and never give a starving bum enough solid feed to last him until christmas monday and not a damned drop to drink nothing but coffeeand without no milk i tell you mr ammermeyer it makes a mans blood boil freds duly boiled and to immediate effect by noon the next day he had rented the largest hall on the waterfront and sent word to the newspapers that arrangements for a christmas party for bums to end all christmas parties for bums were under way his plan for it was extremely simple the first obligation of hospitality he announced somewhat prissily was to find out precisely what ones guests wanted and the second was to give it to them with a free and even reckless hand as for what his proposed guests wanted he had no shade of doubt for he was a man of worldly experience and he had also of course the advice of his friend the lieutenant a recognized expert in the psychology of the abandoned first and foremost they wanted as much malt liquor as they would buy themselves if they had the means to buy it second they wanted a dinner that went on in rhythmic waves all day and all night until the hungriest and hollowest bum was reduced to breathing with not more than one cylinder of one lung third they wanted not a mere sufficiency but a riotous superfluity of the best fivecent cigars on sale on the baltimore wharves fourth they wanted continuous entertainment both theatrical and musical of a sort in consonance with their natural tastes and their station in life fifth and last they wanted complete freedom from evangelical harassment of whatever sort before during and after the secular ceremonies on this last point fred laid special stress and every city editor in baltimore had to hear him expound it in person i was one of those city editors and i well recall his great earnestness amounting almost to moral indignation it was an unendurable outrage he argued to invite a poor man to a free meal and then make him wait for it while he was battered with criticism of his ways however well intended and it was an even greater outrage to call upon him to stand up in public and confess to all the false steps of what may have been a long and much troubled life fred was determined he said to give a party that would be devoid of all the blemishes of the similar parties staged by the salvation army the mission helpers and other such nefarious outfits if it cost him his last cent he would give the bums of baltimore massive and unforgettable proof that philanthropy was by no means a monopoly of gospel sharksthat its highest development in truth was to be found among freethinkers it might have cost him his last cent if he had gone it alone for he was by no means a man of wealth but his announcement had hardly got out before he was swamped with offers of help leopold bortsch pledged twentyfive barrels of scharnhorst beer and every other totsaufer in baltimore rushed up to match him the baltimore agents of the pennsylvania twofer factories fought for the privilege of contributing the cigars the poultry dealers of lexington fells point and cross street markets threw in barrel after barrel of dressed turkeys some of them in very fair condition the members of the boss bakers association not a few of them freethinkers themselves promised all the bread none more than two days old that all the bums of the chesapeake littoral could eat and the publicrelations counsel of the celery trust the cranberry trust the sauerkraut trust and a dozen other such cartels and combinations leaped at the chance to serve if fred had to fork up cash for any part of the chow it must have been for the pepper and salt alone but the rent of the hall had to be paid and not only paid but paid in advance for the owner thereof was a methodist deacon and there were many other expenses of considerable sizefor example for the entertainment the music the waiters and bartenders and the mistletoe and immortelles which decorated the ball fred if he had desired might have got the free services of whole herds of amateur musicians and elocutionists but he swept them aside disdainfully for he was determined to give his guests a strictly professional show he got of course some contributions in cash from rich freethinkers but when the smoke cleared away at last and he totted up his books he found that the party had set him back more than a hundred and seventyfive dollars admission to it was by invitation only and the guests were selected with a critical and bilious eye by the police lieutenant no bum who had ever been known to do any honest workeven such light work as sweeping out a saloonwas on the list by freds express and oftrepeated command it was made up wholly of men completely lost to human decency in whose favor nothing whatsoever could be said the doors opened at am of christmas day and the first canto of the dinner began instantly there were none of the usual preliminariesno opening prayer no singing of a hymn no remarks by fred himself not even a fanfare by the band the bums simply shuffled and shoved their way to the tables and simultaneously the waiters and sommeliers poured in with the chow and the malt for half an hour no sound was heard save the rattle of crockery the chompchomp of mastication and the grateful grunts and oh boys of the assembled underprivileged then the cigars were passed round not one but half a dozen to every man the band cut loose with the tonic chord of g major and the burlesque company plunged into act i sc of krausmeyers alley there were in those days as oldtimers will recall no less than five standard versions of this classic ranging in refinement all the way from one so tony that it might have been put on at the union theological seminary down to one so rowdy that it was fit only for audiences of policemen bums newspaper reporters and medical students this last was called the cincinnati version because cincinnati was then the only great american city whose mores tolerated it fred gave instructions that it was to be played a outrance and con fuoco with no salvo of slapsticks however brutal omitted and no doubleentendre however daring let the boys have it he instructed the chief comedian larry snodgrass straight in the eye and direct from the wood they were poor men and full of sorrow and he wanted to give them on at least one redletter day a horsedoctors dose of the kind of humor they really liked in that remote era the girls of the company could add but little to the exhilarating grossness of the performance for the strip tease was not yet invented and even the shimmy was still only nascent but they did the best they could with the muscle dancing launched by little egypt at the chicago worlds fair and that best was not to be sneezed at for they were all in hearty sympathy with freds agenda and furthermore they cherished the usual hope of stage folk that charles frohman or abe erlanger might be in the audience fred had demanded that they all appear in red tights but there were not enough red tights in hand to outfit more than half of them so larry snodgrass conceived the bold idea of sending on the rest with bare legs it was a revolutionary indelicacy and for a startled moment or two the police lieutenant wondered whether he was not bound by his hippocratic oath to raid the show but when be saw the whole audience leap up and break into cheers his dubieties vanished and five minutes later he was roaring himself when larry and the other comedians began paddling the girls cabooses with slapsticks i have seen many a magnificent performance of krausmeyers alley in my time including a byzantine version called krausmeyers dispensary staged by the students at the johns hopkins medical school but never have i seen a better one larry and his colleagues simply gave their all wherever on ordinary occasions there would have been a laugh they evoked a roar and where there would have been roars they produced something akin to asphyxia and apoplexy even the members of the musicians union were forced more than once to lay down their fiddles and cornets and bust into laughter in fact they enjoyed the show so vastly that when the comedians retired for breath and the girls came out to sing sweet rosie ogrady or i have been workin on the railroad the accompaniment was full of all the outlaw glissandi and sforzandi that we now associate with jazz the show continued at high tempo until pm when fred shut it down to give his guests a chance to eat the second canto of their dinner it was a duplicate of the first in every detail with second and third helpings of turkey sauerkraut mashed potatoes and celery for everyone who called for them and a pitcher of beer in front of each guest the boys ground away at it for an hour and then lit fresh cigars and leaned back comfortably for the second part of the show it was still basically krausmeyers alley but it was a krausmeyers alley adorned and bedizened with reminiscences of every other burlesqueshow curtain raiser and afterpiece in the repertory it went on and on for four solid hours with larry and his pals bending themselves to their utmost exertions and the girls shaking their legs in almost frantic abandon at the end of an hour the members of the musicians union demanded a cutin on the beer and got it and immediately afterward the sommeliers began passing pitchers to the performers on the stage meanwhile the pitchers on the tables of the guests were kept replenished cigars were passed round at short intervals and the waiters came in with pretzels potato chips celery radishes and chipped beef to stay the stomachs of those accustomed to the freelunch way of life at pm precisely fred gave the signal for a hiatus in the entertainment and the waiters rushed in with the third canto of the dinner the supply of roast turkey though it had been enormous was beginning to show signs of wear by this time but fred had in reserve twenty hams and forty pork shoulders the contribution of george wienefeldter president of the weinefeldter bros schmidt sanitary packing co inc also he had a mine of reserve sauerkraut hidden down under the stage and soon it was in free and copious circulation and the guests were taking heroic hacks at it this time they finished in threequarters of an hour but fred filled the time until pm by ordering a seventh inning stretch and by having the police lieutenant go to the stage and assure all hands that any bonafide participant found on the streets at the conclusion of the exercises with his transmission jammed would not be clubbed and jugged as was the baltimore custom at the time but returned to the hall to sleep it off on the floor this announcement made a favorable impression and the brethren settled down for the resumption of the show in a very pleasant mood larry and his associates were pretty well fagged out by now for the sort of acting demanded by the burlesque profession is very fatiguing but you would never have guessed it by watching them work at ten the show stopped again and there began what fred described as a bierabend that is a beer evening extra pitchers were put on every table more cigars were banded about and the waiters spread a substantial lunch of rye bread rattrap cheese ham bologna potato salad liver pudding and blutwurst fred announced from the stage that the performers needed a rest and would not be called upon again until twelve of the clock when a midnight show would begin but that in the interval any guest or guests with a tendency to song might step up and show his or their stuff no less than a dozen volunteers at once went forward but fred had the happy thought of beginning with a quartet and so all save the first four were asked to wait the four laid their heads together the band played the vamp of sweet adeline and they were off it was not such singing as one hears from the harvard glee club or the bach choir at bethlehem pennsylvania but it was at least as good as the barbershop stuff that hillbillies now emit over the radio the other guests applauded politely and the quartet operating briskly under malt and hop power proceeded to do not you hear dem bells and aunt dinahs quilting party then the four singers had a nosetonose palaver and the first tenor proceeded somewhat shakily to a conference with otto strauss the leader of the orchestra from where i sat at the back of the hall beside fred i could see otto shake his head but the tenor persisted in whatever he was saying and after a moment otto shrugged resignedly and the members of the quartet again took their stances fred leaned forward eagerly curious to hear what their next selection would be he found out at once it was are you ready for the judgment day the prime favorite of the period in all the sailors bethels helpingup missions salvation army bum traps and other such joints along the waterfront freds horror and amazement and sense of insult were so vast that he was completely speechless and all i heard out of him while the singing went on was a series of sepulchral groans the man was plainly suffering cruelly but what could i do what indeed could anyone do for the quartet had barely got half way through the first stanza of the composition before the whole audience joined in and it joined in with even heartier enthusiasm when the boys on the stage proceeded to showers of blessings the no favorite of all seasoned mission stiffs and then to throw out the lifeline and then to where shall we spend eternity and then to wash me and i shall be whiter than snow half way along in this orgy of hymnody the police lieutenant took fred by the arm and led him out into the cold stinging corpsereviving air of a baltimore winter night the bums at this stage were beating time on the tables with their beer glasses and tears were trickling down their noses otto and his band knew none of the hymns so their accompaniment became sketchier and sketchier and presently they shut down altogether by this time the members of the quartet began to be winded and soon there was a halt in the ensuing silence there arose a quavering boozy sclerotic voice from the floor friends it began i just want to tell you what these good people have done for mehow their prayers have saved a sinner who seemed past all redemption friends i had a good mother and i was brought up under the influence of the word but in my young manhood my sainted mother was called to heaven my poor father took to rum and opium and i was led by the devil into the hands of wicked menyes and wicked women too oh what a shameful story i have to tell it would shock you to hear it even if i told you only half of it i let myself be i waited for no more but slunk into the night fred and the police lieutenant had both vanished and i did not see fred again for a week but the next day i encountered the lieutenant on the street and he hailed me sadly well be said what could you expect from them bums it was the force of habit that is what it was they have been eating mission handouts so long they cannot help it whenever they smell coffee they begin to confess think of all that good food wasted and all that beer and all them cigarsembed
